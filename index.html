 <h2> Little Women Synopsis & Character Breakdown</h2>
 <h5> September 30, 2022 by Narda Sharpe </h5>

 <p> Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are raised in genteel poverty by their loving mother, Marmee, in a quiet Massachusetts town while their father serves as an army chaplain during the American Civil War.
   They befriend Theodore Lawrence (Laurie), the lonely grandson of a rich old man next door. The vital force of the family is Jo, a headstrong tomboy who is the emotional centre of the book.
   In the course of the novel, beautiful, vain Meg marries Laurie’s tutor, John Brooke, and starts her own family; quiet, sickly Beth dies from scarlet fever; artistic Amy marries Laurie after he is turned down by Jo.
   Jo marries Professor Bhaer, whom she meets while living in a boardinghouse, and together they set up a school for boys.</p>
 <p> The protagonist of the novel, and the second-oldest March sister. Jo, who wants to be a writer, is based on Louisa May Alcott herself, which makes the story semi-autobiographical.
     Jo has a temper and a quick tongue, although she works hard to control both. She is a tomboy, and reacts with impatience to the many limitations placed on women and girls. 
     She hates romance in her real life, and wants nothing more than to hold her family together. The oldest March sister. Responsible and kind, Meg mothers her younger sisters. 
     She has a small weakness for luxury and leisure, but the greater part of her is gentle, loving, and morally vigorous. The third March daughter. Beth is very quiet and very virtuous, and she does nothing but try to please others. 
     She adores music and plays the piano very well.</p>
